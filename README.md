# Dungeon-siege-2-1920x1080p&2560 × 1440-fix
A fix I made for dungeon siege 2 allowing 1920x1080p and 2560 × 1440p for the game. Can be selected from the DSVideoConfig in the game root folder.

Back up the original Gas file in case you are using another version besides steam or if i screwed something up.
Not sure how to fix the missing cursor without using "fullscreen = false" in the games .ini file.
Just replace the system_detail.gas file in the games root directory and then open DSVideoConfig and you should be able to choose 1920x1080p.
Not sure ill be able to fix any issues that arise as i just tried this out and it worked when i was trying to add my laptops crappy integrated GPU to the game.
